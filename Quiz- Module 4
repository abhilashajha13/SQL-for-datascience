1)Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. 
Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName || " " || LastName AS FullName, UPPER(City || " " || Country) AS CityCountry
FROM Customers

2)Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name.
Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.

SELECT firstname , lastname ,
lower(substr(firstname,1,4)) || (substr(lastname,1,2)) as employeeid
FROM employees

3)Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. 
Sort by lastname ascending.

SELECT firstname,lastname , 
STRFTIME ('%Y','now') - STRFTIME ('%Y',hiredate) as yearsworked
from employees where yearsworked >=15 order by lastname asc

4)Profiling the Customers table, answer the following question.

SELECT * from customers where [col_name] is null

Answer: Postal Code, Company, Fax, Phone

5)Find the cities with the most customers and rank in descending order.

select city , count(customerid) as customercount
from customers
group by city
order by customercount desc

6)Create a new customer invoice id by combining a customer’s invoice id with their first and 
last name while ordering your query in the following order: firstname, lastname, and invoiceID.

select c.firstname, c.lastname , i.invoiceid ,
c.FirstName || c.LastName || i.InvoiceID AS NewId
from customers c inner join invoices i on c.customerid = i.customerid
where NewId like 'AstridGruber%'
